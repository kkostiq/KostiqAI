# KostiqAI: The Unpredictable Minecraft AI Director

> KostiqAI is a server-side Minecraft mod for Fabric that introduces a dynamic "AI Director" to your world. Its goal is to create unpredictable, challenging, and hilarious moments by analyzing player behavior and triggering a wide range of "actions" or "pranks."

Whether you want a constantly evolving challenge for experienced players or just want to add some chaos to your server, KostiqAI delivers. It can be powered by a sophisticated OpenAI integration or a robust built-in heuristic planner that provides a balanced experience without any external setup.

## ‚ú® Features

* üß† **Dynamic AI Director:** An intelligent planner that observes players and triggers actions to keep the game interesting.
* ü§ñ **Optional OpenAI Integration:** Connect to the OpenAI API (e.g., GPT-4o mini) for advanced, context-aware decision-making.
* üîß **Robust Heuristic Planner:** A powerful built-in mode that intelligently selects actions based on player state and game difficulty‚Äî**no API key required!**
* üìà **Difficulty Curves:** Choose between three distinct modes:
    * **Linear:** A consistent, medium level of challenge.
    * **Progressive:** Starts easy and gets relentlessly harder over time.
    * **Balanced:** Cycles between periods of calm ("safe") and intense chaos ("nasty").
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Highly Configurable:** Control everything from the time between events to player-specific difficulty settings and banned actions via in-game commands.
* üí• **Huge Variety of Actions:** From subtle pranks like shuffling a player's hotbar to major events like spawning a temporary Wither, the mod has a massive arsenal of tricks.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

This is a server-side mod for the Fabric mod loader.

1.  Ensure you have a Fabric server set up for Minecraft 1.21.x.
2.  Download the latest release of the `KostiqAI.jar` file from the project's **Releases** page.
3.  Place the `.jar` file into your server's `/mods` folder.
4.  Restart your server. The mod will generate a default configuration file at `config/kostiqai.json`.
5.  By default, the mod will use its powerful **built-in Heuristic planner**. If you want to use the OpenAI planner, follow the steps in the next section.

## ü§ñ Configuring the OpenAI Planner (Optional)

You can enable a more advanced AI planner by connecting the mod to your OpenAI account.

**Important:** For security, the API key **cannot** be set with an in-game command. You must set it as an **environment variable** in your server's terminal *before* you launch the server JAR.

### Step 1: Set the Environment Variable

Choose the command for your server's operating system.

#### On Linux or macOS

```bash
# 1. Set the variable in your terminal
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-YourSecretApiKeyGoesHere"

# 2. Then, start your server in the SAME terminal window
java -jar fabric-server-launch.jar
```

#### On Windows (Command Prompt - CMD)

```batch
:: 1. Set the variable in your command prompt
set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-YourSecretApiKeyGoesHere

:: 2. Then, start your server in the SAME window
java -jar fabric-server-launch.jar
```

#### On Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
# 1. Set the variable in your PowerShell window
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-YourSecretApiKeyGoesHere"

# 2. Then, start your server in the SAME window
java -jar fabric-server-launch.jar
```

> **Note:** This variable must be set this way every time you restart the server. For a permanent solution, you can add the command to your server's start script or set it globally in your OS.

### Step 2: Enable AI Mode In-Game

Once the server is running with the environment variable set, use the following command in-game:
`/kostiqai config ai true`

The mod will now use the OpenAI planner. You can switch back to the built-in planner at any time with `/kostiqai config ai false`.
